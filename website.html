          <h3>Xronus Speed Booster</h3>
          <p>The Xronus Speed Booster is designed to demonstrate how “boosting tools” might appear in a product catalog.

          <h3>Xronus Wall Vision</h3>
          <p>Wall Vision is a mock-up product that illustrates how advanced tools such as vision assists are often displayed on cheat-selling sites. It is described as a feature that could allow players to see through obstacles, offering an advantage in competitive games. For this project, however, it exists only as a placeholder, meant to highlight web design, layout, and descriptive writing for digital products.</p>
